How to Obtain Your Own Firebase Service Account JSON
Go to your Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Service Accounts.
Click Generate new private key and download the JSON file.
Move the file to a secure location in your project directory (e.g., outside the repo).
How to Use the JSON Securely
Local Development: Store the path in an environment variable:

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="$HOME/.config/socialconnect-credentials.json"
Production Deployment: Use secrets management tools like Google Secret Manager or GitHub Actions Secrets instead of hardcoding it.

## üì≤ Testing Push Notifications (For Reviewers & Recruiters)

This project includes **real-time push notifications** using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) with support for **deep linking** ‚Äî so you can send a notification and navigate directly to a specific screen within the app.

To test this feature manually, follow the instructions below.

---

### ‚úÖ Send a Test Notification with `curl`

You can use the Firebase HTTP v1 API to send a notification using a simple `curl` command:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://fcm.googleapis.com/v1/projects/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>/messages:send" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": {
      "token": "<YOUR_DEVICE_FCM_TOKEN>",
      "notification": {
        "title": "üöÄ Push Test from FCM V1",
        "body": "This is a test notification sent via Firebase API V1!"
      },
      "data": {
        "category": "PROFILE"
      }
    }
  }'


Replace the placeholders:
Placeholder	Description
<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>	Your Firebase project ID (e.g., socialconnect-d72ef)
<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>	A valid OAuth 2.0 token generated using a Firebase Service Account
<YOUR_DEVICE_FCM_TOKEN>	The device token shown in Xcode console when the app runs
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This project does not expose any real tokens for security reasons. You‚Äôll need to set these up in your own Firebase Console.


Deep Link Categories
The app supports smart navigation via the category key in the data payload. Try changing it to:

"category": "PROFILE" ‚Üí Opens the profile screen

"category": "SETTINGS" ‚Üí Opens the settings screen

"category": "POST_DETAILS" ‚Üí Opens a sample post view (if implemented)

This is handled by the DeepLinkHandler in the app via FCM data messages.

### üõ† Running the Backend Server (Important Instruction for README)
To ensure the app retrieves data correctly, users must start the backend server before running the project.

How to Start the Backend Server
Open Terminal and navigate to the backend folder:

```cd path/to/backend ```
(Replace path/to/backend with the actual path to your backend directory.)

Run the server using Node.js:


```node server.js```

The backend should now be running, and the app will be able to fetch data successfully.

**‚ö† Important: Ensure you have Node.js installed before running this command. If you don‚Äôt have it, install it from nodejs.org.**

**This instruction is critical for users to receive data on their device or simulator.**

---

### **Ensure `.gitignore` is Configured**
Run:
```sh
git check-ignore -v SocialConnect/GoogleService-Info.plist credentials.plist
```
If `GoogleService-Info.plist` or `credentials.plist` is **not ignored**, add them to `.gitignore`:
```sh
# Ignore sensitive files
SocialConnect/GoogleService-Info.plist
SocialConnect/credentials.plist
```

Then commit:
```sh
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Updated .gitignore to ignore sensitive files"
git push origin main
```

---

## üöÄ Run the App
Start the project in **Xcode**:
```sh
Cmd + R
```
**If everything is set up correctly, the app should launch without API errors.**  

---
